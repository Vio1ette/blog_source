什么是定语从句？

用一句话作定语，通常用来修饰名词、代词，被修饰的词称为`先行词`

### 一、限制性定语从句

引导词**代替先行词**，在定语从句**充当成分**

> 对比宾语从句中，`that`不充当任何成分，可以省略

#### 1. 关系代词：

- 指代**人**：`who`（在从句中充当主语、宾语）、`whom`（充当宾语）

  The man `who(that) robbed him` has been arrested.

  The girl `whom I saw` told me to come back today.

  The friend `with whom I was traveling` spoke French.

- 指代**物**：`which`（主、宾）

  The car `which (that) I hired` broke down.

  I don't like the novel `which you are reading`.

- 指代**人或物**：`that`（主、宾），`whose`（定语，意思是`谁的`）

  I like the girl `whose eyes are very big`.

#### 2. 关系副词：

- `when`（时间状语）：指代**时间**

  At the time `when` I saw him, he was quite strong.

  I will never forget the day `when (on which)` I came to Beijing.

- where`（地点状语）：表示地点`

  This is the village `where` I was born.

  The police searched the house `where (in which)` he lived.

- `why`（原因状语）：`why`的先行词只能是`reason`

  I don't know the reason `why (for which)` he is angry.

### 3. 省略

- 在**限制性定语从句**中，当关系代词在从句中作**宾语**时，一般都可以**省略**

  Have you got everything (`that`) you need?

  That's the only thing (`that`) we can do now.

  You can take any room (`that`) you like.

- **口语**中，在从句作**主语**也可以**省略**

  There's a strange man (`that`) lives in that small village.

  There's something (`that`) keeps worrying me.

#### 4. 有些表示时间的定语从句并不由when引导

This was the first `time` I had serious trouble with my boss.

Every `time` the telephone rings, he gets nervous.

#### 5. way后也可跟定语从句，不需要关系代词或副词

I didn't like the way he eyed me. 【应该是方式状语？】

### 二、非限制性定语从句

**非限制性定语从句**对所修饰的词没有限制词义的作用，而只是补充说明，通常都有逗号，译成中文时，多翻译为并列句

限制性定语从句拿掉以后，句子意思常发生变化。而**非限制性定语**从句拿掉以后，对剩下部分没有太大影响

> 注意非限制性定语从句中**不能**使用**关系代词 that** 和**关系副词 why**，也**不能**省略任何关系副词

Peter, `who` had been driving all day, suggested stopping at the next town.

Paul, `whom` everyone suspected, turned out to be innocent.

The 9:30 train, `which` is usually very punctual, was late today.

Sunday is a holiday, `when` people do not go to work.

#### 非限制性定语从句中，which 和 whom 和 of 或其他介词连用

The buses, `most of which` were already full, were surrounded by an angry crowd.

She had eight children, `three of whom` lived to grow up. ( three of whom 在从句中作主语 )

Her sons, `both of whom` work abroad, ring her up every week. 

I met the fruit-pickers, `several of whom` were college students.

#### which 有时代表一个句子

They rely on themselves, `which` is much better.

He invited us to dinner, `which` was very kind of him.

He changed his mind, `which` made me very angry.

She was very patient towards the children, `which` her husband seldom was.
