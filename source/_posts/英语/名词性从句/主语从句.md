## 1. 三种类型的主语从句

###### (1) 由 `that` 引导的主语从句

​	<u>That</u> he hasn't arrived is odd.

​	It's certain <u>that</u> prices will go up.

###### (2) 由<u>连接代（副）词</u>引导的主语从句

<u>	Why</u> he left wasn't Important.

<u>	It</u> was uncertain <u>whether</u> he would come or not.

###### (3) 由关系代词型和 <u>what</u> 和 <u>whatever</u> 引导的从句：

<u>	What I want</u> is a canvas travelling bag.

<u>	Whatever she did</u> was right.

一般都用 `it` 作形式主语

###### a. it + be + 形容词 + that 从句

<u>It</u> is natural <u>that</u> they should have different views.

<u>It</u> was quite plain <u>that</u> she didn't want to come.

###### b. it + be + 名词 + that 从句

###### c. it + 动词 + （宾、状） + that

<u>It</u> never occurred to me <u>that</u> perhaps she was lying.

###### d. it + 动词的被动语态 + that 从句

###### 在口语中 `that` 有时可以省略
